== Contributing

PRs are welcome.

=== Committing

This repository is set up with AngularJS commit message convention.
Pre-commit hook will invoke interactive prompt, powered by Commitizen,
that will ask you for information and put together a commit message for you.

To follow the convention:

* Only use ``git commit`` when making commits
* Don’t use built-in IDE commit prompts, since they may bypass prepare-commit-msg hook

=== Pulling

- It is recommended to use “rebase” behavior of pull (make sure to use fresh Git)
  by having this in your global .gitconfig:
+
[source]
----
[pull]
    rebase = true
----

- When pulling, Commitizen commit prompt may appear even if there is no merge commit to be made.
  You can dismiss it with Ctrl+C.

=== Pushing

There is a pre-push Git hook that compiles the app.
This helps us catch compilation errors before code reaches CI.
